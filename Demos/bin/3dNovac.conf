		<SokobanDemo>SokobanDemo is a small remake of the old game sokoban in 3 dimensions.
This demo demonstrates how to create a very simple game in 3 dimension, by loading a map, meshes, textures, moving objects, etc...

Usage:
Use the arrows to move the player.
Right click and WSAD keys to move the camera.</SokobanDemo>
		<FBEffectsDemo>FBEffectsDemo shows an enlightened scene with a sketch effect. 
This demo demonstrates how to render the scene into a texture by using a framebuffer and applying a post process effect.

Usage:
Right click and WSAD keys to move the camera.</FBEffectsDemo>
		<FrustumDemo>FrustumDemo shows a scene organised into an octree and rendered two times with two different camera in wich one is only displaying the objects that can be seen by it's frustum.
It also display the frustum of the first camera.
This demo demonstrates how to setup an octree and optimize the performance by displaying only the objects that can be seen by the camera.
It also shows how to manage more than one camera.

Usage:
Right click and WSAD keys to move the camera.</FrustumDemo>
		<LightDemo>LightDemo shows an enlightened scene with a bump mapping effect and with lights of different colors.
This demo demonstrates how to load a mesh and apply a lighting effect to it.

Usage:
Right click and WSAD keys to move the camera.</LightDemo>
		<SimpleParticleEffect>SimpleParticleEffect shows a simple effect of explosions.
This demo demonstrates how to create a particle generator with shader.

Usage:
Right click and WSAD keys to move the camera.</SimpleParticleEffect>
		<bSplinesDemo>bSplinesDemo is an old Mathematic projetcs which shows two different curve. A spline and a nurb.
This demo demonstrates how to create your own object with it's own drawable and geometry.

Usage:
Use the arrows to move the current interpolation point.
Press Space to change the current interpolation point.
Press 1 or 2 to see another bSpline Object.</bSplinesDemo>
