	<div class="title">Introduction</div>
	This tutorial will explain you how to install the framework 3dNovac under Linux and Windows.

	To run 3dNovac Demos, Examples and Nc-Graphics programs you'll have to install and update your graphical drivers,
	3dNovac does not support an anterior version of OpenGL 3.

	3dNovac uses the CMake building system to target several platforms and compilers.
	At the moment 3dNovac supports the following development platforms:
	   - Linux: GNU gcc compiler using Makefiles or the IDE CodeBlocks.
	   - Windows: Visual Studio 2010

	Note that CMake supports many other platforms and operating systems as well, in wich you can probably also run 3dNovac.

	<div class="title">Getting the latest version</div>
	To get the latest version of 3dNovac, you can follow the instructions on the <a target=_blank href="http://3dNovac.eu/Download">Download page</a>.

	<div class="title">Building 3dNovac under Linux</div>
 Installing dependancies for 3dNovac packages under Ubuntu (for other distribution, the name of the packages might differ):
 \code
 apt-get install build-essential libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxpm-dev libpng12-dev libfreetype6-dev
 \endcode

 Installing dependancies for the plugin FileFormatCollada:
 \code
 apt-get install libboost-filesystem-dev libxml2-dev libpcre3-dev
 \endcode

 3dNovac use cmake.
 \code
 // if cmake is not installed
 apt-get install cmake
 \endcode

 So you can generate a makefile or a Codeblocks project with those commands in the '/Build' folder:
 \code
 // Generating unix makefile
 cmake -G"Unix Makefiles"

 // Or Generating Codeblock project
 cmake -G"CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles"
 \endcode

 Finally you can build the project.
 \code
 make
 \endcode

	The libraries will be build into the folder '/lib'


	<div class="title">Building 3dNovac under Windows</div>
	To build 3dNovac under windows, every dependancies are provided so you will only need to install cmake.
	We recommend you to use cmake-gui.

	Here is a screen shot of what you should get before generating the project:
	\image html cmake-gui.png

	Click the Configure button and choose the Visual studio generator.

	Then youâ€™ll just have to open and build the 3dNovac generated solution with visual studio.


	<div class="title">Building the 3dNovac Demos and Examples</div>
	The 3dNovac Demos and Examples use also cmake, so it's easy to build them like the 3dNovac framework.
	There is no additional dependencies.

	Build the samples into the folder '/Demos/Build' and '/Examples/Build' and execute the samples into the folder '/Demos/bin' and 'Examples/bin'.
